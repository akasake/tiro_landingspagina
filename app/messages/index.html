            <p class="message message2 message-detective">I see you have arrived. I am going ask Sarah's family for a picture to post on the mising dog forum. Meanwhile, you can look around with the clue detector in the park.</p>
            <p class="message message3 message-detective">Nice find! Let me analyze the clue and I’ll get back to you. Keep an eye on the forum for me while I’m busy.</p>

            <p class="message message5 message-detective">Great! The clue you found told me that the dogs stepped in a puddle of mud. Look for paw prints at Carrefour express</p>
            <p class="message message6 message-detective">You found the dog! Great work! You were a real detective out there. Hope you will help me again sometime!</p>
